## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, our group’s collaboration and communication were strong throughout this unit. Regular use of Slack for communication ensured that everyone stayed informed and allowed us to address questions and share updates in real-time. This consistent, open communication and teamwork were essential to our progress and efficiency, enabling us to stay aligned and work effectively toward our goals.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

A challenge our group faced in this unit was adjusting to the absence of one member who couldn’t participate in this milestone due to health issues. This meant we had to redistribute tasks and take on additional responsibilities to ensure everything was completed on time. Despite this setback, we communicated effectively, stayed organized, and supported each other to successfully finish all tasks within the deadline.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We plan to incorporate login functionality in the future, so we might require help with it.
