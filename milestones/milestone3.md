## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Throughout this unit, our team communicated effectively. We supported each other, quickly overcoming any issues we encountered. With good time management and a positive atmosphere, we completed our work promptly and without disruptions.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We faced a problem when trying to assign issues to our repository, as it didn’t show up as an option. Eventually, we resolved it; the issue feature hadn’t been enabled in the settings.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

All tasks for this week’s sprint plan were successfully completed. Had there been any outstanding tasks, we would have organized them based on priority and dependencies to keep our project on track.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The login feature could be flagged as "at risk" due to possible complexities. If it remains a challenge, we’ll set aside extra time for troubleshooting and may consider external support or alternative authentication methods to ensure effective implementation.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We would appreciate having a mentor review our work and offer guidance to keep us on track. Their feedback will help us make improvements and prevent possible issues, which is essential for the success of our project.
